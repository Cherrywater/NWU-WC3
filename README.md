# How to change version

Two simple steps:

1) In WorldEdit, go to Scenerario -> Map Description. Then change "Name" field to whatever you want. Example: NWU |cffff8c001.3.9h|r. Then Save map.
2) Open exported/Constants/war3mapSkin.txt and change UPKEEP_NONE=|cff99ccffv1.3.9h|r (should be on line 3). Save file.

# Game Constants

"Gameplay Constants" and "Game Interface"  should be changed using the files inside exported/Constants foolder. Thanks to this, we can track the changes in constants.

There is a script inside map that will merge map constants with the constans inside exported/Constants foolder.
